# Comparativ-study-of-DL-Models-for-NLP

Deep learning (DL) models have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks, prompting a comparative analysis in this study focusing on sentiment analysis and textual entailment. Sentiment analysis categorizes text into positive, negative sentiments, while Natural Language Inference assesses logical inference between premises and hypotheses, leveraging DL techniques including attention mechanisms and transformers. DL models such as CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Bi-LSTMs, and Bi-GRUs excel due to their sequential data analysis capabilities. A systematic process of data preprocessing is followed to ensure consistency and comparability across models. Each model is trained on relevant datasets for sentiment analysis and Natural Language Inference. Trained models are then evaluated on the test set using the evaluate method to calculate test accuracy and loss. Additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are also calculated. Models are compared to determine the most effective one for each task. The assessment, considering computational efficiency, interpretability, task complexity, and model suitability, aids in selecting the most appropriate DL model for NLP tasks, providing insights into their strengths, limitations, and application suitability.
